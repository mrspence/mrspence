## Why this article?

It's now almost customary for developers to explain what their new website is built with.

But this website is different. It's not WordPress. Or Squarespace. Or any Content Management System even.

[Skip to TLDR](#tldr)

## Why not use a Content Management System (CMS)

When writing web articles, it's often useful to have an editor that allows you to do bolding, italics, font sizing

## TL;DR

Github, GitHub Pages, React, Next.JS, MDX (Markdown), Tailwind JIT

export default ({ children }) => <PostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</PostLayout>
