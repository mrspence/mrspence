## The problem with heavy ass frameworks

For complete clarity, by "heavy ass frameworks" we're including:

* D3.js
* Chart.js
* Frappe Charts
* *and Recharts, Toast UI Charts, and many more...*

There's no doubt they all offer incredibly useful resources and visualisations, interactivity, and easy integration. MVP heaven.

</div>

But their size is potentially their un-doing. All of these frameworks will force the developer to either sacrifice **performance** or **customisability**.

## Solution: the new graph framework

Our ideal graph framework should look gorgeous, be incredibly performant, and allow the developer to exactly match their client's brief.

Enter, **Charts CSS**.
