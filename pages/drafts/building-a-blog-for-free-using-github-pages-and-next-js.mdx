# Back story

If you're like me, then at some point in your life you've also dreamed of creating a shiny, rich and valuable blog.
If you also consider yourself a perfectionist, it feels almost like an *impossible* task.

The colours, the theme, the technology stack the whole blog sits on...

...and utterly key: content.

Let me help you out here - the most important part is your written content. Fuck the look and feel of the blog for 5 seconds and EMBRACE the real value in a blog.

Now I won't claim my blog is "pure value" (it is ðŸ˜‰), but by pumping out articles, you can begin to learn what even works - do not overthink it before you've begun!

It would be great if I'd taken my own advice sooner... but here we are, 6 years later with a blog finally starting up and boy am I excited to see where this takes you and I.


# Introduction

In this article we will build a static blog framework with Next JS and GitHub Pages, using the same principles originally inspired by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I always admire how easy Jekyll makes it for beginners to begin a blog, while offering control for the more advanced developers.

<div className="text-center pt-4 pb-8">
    <img src="/images/posts/1/1-jekyll.png" alt="Jekyll" className="!mb-3 mx-auto rounded-lg" />
    <small className="italic opacity-90"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">11,280+ commits</a>... wowsa</small>
</div>

However, recently I wanted to build a [new blogging website](https://matt-spence.com), and I was horrified with how *horrendously slow* it felt to compile with just 1 single page.

Perhaps I had a misconfiguration affecting compile time, but after a play I decided to at least investigate more options.

</div>

See, I'm incredibly fickle when testing frameworks, languages and libs early on a project. They're supposed to speed up your development and create a magical experience.

If it's the dawn of your project, now is your chance to easily switch the game.

After some research into static site generation and weighing up a few ecosystems, enter Node JS.

    <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/wHAqhMGRiXrufV5K86/giphy.gif" alt="Enter Node JS..." className="mx-auto rounded-lg" />
</div>

Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Reddit, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and PayPal [all use Node JS](https://www.similartech.com/technologies/nodejs).

Tellingly, [PayPal saw a 35% speed-up](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/node-js-at-paypal-4e2d1d08ce4f) in average response time on its page after deploying Node JS.

That was over 7 years ago and it was a small bunny back then. Now Node JS's ecosystem swings with quite the ~~chode~~, the largest on the planet.

With the rise and maturing of Node JS, I became curious if in 2021 there was a new solution that still held the same values as Jekyll.

As it turns out, with Node JS and the huge popularity of React combined, there is now a well oiled machine called Next JS where, among other powerful gems, static websites can be rapidly forged.

## But hold up, let me check: is this the right tech stack for you?

Your time is valuable, rather like mine, so let me help you out here! ([Or skip to the good stuff](#why-next-js-and-github-pages))

This tech stack is staggeringly **useful** for developers who want to showcase interactive works of art.

It **is not for** those looking to just only pump out many text-only articles quickly to an audience.

This stack is intended for you to "play god" and create a blogging website that truly brings your imagination to life.

As a developer, you will need to be comfortable with:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- An IDLE editor
- Your usual HTML, CSS, and particularly JavaScript / [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), if you want a quicker writing experience (optional)

If this isn't you and you want a decent text/image based blog, do not despair!

Drop this article because there's already a brilliant solution out there: check out
Medium.com, which is currently [the fastest growing blogging platform](https://medium.com/). Plus the content value is beyond awesome.

Beats WordPress. Then again, anything does.

*FYI - sadly, I'm not paid or endorsed by Medium, yet - you'll find they're a superior platform with substance, and I'm a frequent reader!*

## Why Next JS and Github Pages

With any tech stack, you should ask, quite seriously, why. WHY.

I'll tell you why we **should** use GitHub Pages:

- It's free. I mean, that's pretty big. You can use Github Pages to host any static website right from a GitHub Repository. They also have really, [really generous and soft usage limits](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#usage-limits)
- Free remote version source control
- No databases, keepin' it simple

I'll also praise why we **should** use Next JS:

- Growing community support
- Very quick to pickup with a digestible learning curve
- Seriously speedy

## Lets get started

Right lets do it.

### GitHub

First, register your ass up to Github if you haven't already!

Next, create a repository that's the same as your username. (this is a magical repository, as GitHub will tell you at the end).

For example, my GitHub username is `mrspence`, so I'll also name the repisitory `mrspence`.

Oh wait, I've already done it! This website runs on it right here: [https://github.com/mrspence/mrspence](https://github.com/mrspence/mrspence).

Once you've gone through GitHub's repo setup steps, get a clone of your empty repo onto your machine: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>`.

### Next JS

Okay, now the fun really begins! Follow the steps below and you may also checkout the [Next JS documentation](https://nextjs.org) should you want to double-check their latest setup guide.

1. Using NPM, install Next JS CLI globally. `npm install -g nextjs-cli`
2. Then lets setup the project! `cd <your-repo-root-directory>`
3. TODO
4.
