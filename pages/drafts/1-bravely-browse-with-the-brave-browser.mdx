## The Browser Wars

**Google Chrome** - wants your data for mad ad-revenue.

**Mozilla Firefox** - open-source privacy advocate, but has quiet deals with search engines.

**Opera** - privacy advocate.

**Safari** - Apple backed proprietary, has a deal with Google, wants your data.

**Edge** - Microsoft backed proprietary, upselling the Bing browser, wants your data for Microsoft.

*(There's more... but my hands could get tired, and there's a whole article yet)*.

Browsers have been launching torpedoes to attract online user attention for many years, as user-time is incredibly valuable.

Back in the 1990s it was just Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator battling it out, now we have many more high market-share browsers in the mix:

## We want Browser battles

Browsers battling for attention promotes rapid improvements for the internet! Seriously, the competition between browsers to support new features
and better performance enhancements has taken internet technology further in the last 15 years than the previous period.

The benefits:

- Internet users get performance enhancements often *weekly*
- Web developers get new paradigms that radically improve the development cycle of a website
- New technology promotes more useful websites
- Accessibility improves every day for users who cannot traditionally use the internet


## Introducing the new boss: Brave Browser

<img src="/images/posts/bravely-browse-with-the-brave-browser/brave-hero.png" alt="Brave Browser" />

Crafted by the creator of JavaScript and former CEO of Mozilla, Brian Bondy founded Brave Software on the 28th May, 2015.

One year later, this living legend released the next-gen Brave Browser.

Today, this browser offers all the same functionality as Google Chrome, but with:

- Built-in anti-tracking and ads that is faster and more effective than any extension on Google Chrome
- Proven faster than other browsers
- Users can earn crypto for browsing the internet by being rewarded if you opt-in to their own privacy-centric ad network

## Earning Crypto

<div className={"text-primary font-bold"}>
    Obligatory notice: I'm #NotYourFinancialAdvisor. Your choices are your own.
</div>

That said, I can now deliver you the sweet news: Brave pays crypto that you can cash out in GBP.

I have used Brave for only 2 weeks. As a web developer, having critiqued many browsers over the years, I can hands-down recommend this browser over any other.

Read more to learn why.

### So how do you earn crypto?

Your internet browser is the most important tool on your computer; it is your gateway to the whole internet.

It is also your biggest privacy leak.

Google, Facebook and Amazon collect over [70% of all digital ad revenue spent online](https://marketingland.com/almost-70-of-digital-ad-spending-going-to-google-facebook-amazon-says-analyst-firm-262565).

Advertisers use these three powerful centralized platforms because they know so much about their audiences.

Google knows:

- Your age
- Your browsing interests
- Your likes and dislikes
- Your favourite type of ****
- and about 200+ more metrics that I cannot be bothered to list

That's just Google.

You're not paid for your data by Google. They like milking their cows.

But Brave pays. If you choose to opt-in and for a **lot less information**.

Brave recognises the centralized ad model is broken, so they made their own; they're [rapidly growing every day](https://brave.com/25m-mau/).

Once you [download Brave](https://brave.com), you can choose to opt-in to their own Ad network. whenever you see one of their ads, you get paid 70% of the original ad
spend from the ad author. You also only see a max of 5 ads an hour, compared to the millions on a Sun article.

Brave then pay you monthly with Crypto under the BAT token. It is then incredibly easy to withdraw these tokens as cold, hard GBP using Uphold.

    <img src="/images/posts/bravely-browse-with-the-brave-browser/brave-bat-token-release-image.png" alt="Brave BAT token" className="!mb-3 mx-auto rounded-lg !max-w-xs" />
    <small className="italic opacity-90">The BAT token logo... looks a little OTT, but very much real.</small>
</div>

### How much can you earn?

When an advertiser publishes to Brave, [70% of the ad-cost goes straight to you, the consumer](https://brave.com/brave-rewards).

How much you earn comes down to how much you use the internet browser, but for perspective I've earned 1.2 BAT over 13 days.
At the time of writing the exchange value for this in GBP is Â£0.70

The more people who take up the Brave browser, the more valued the BAT token becomes, so I don't plan to withdraw for a while and instead invest
for the future by keeping my earnings in BAT or converting to another crypto-currency. However, if you are inclined, you can indeed withdraw
right back to solid *Great* British Pounds.

## You don't have to have Brave ads

Brave confirm that **by default** you are not opted into ANY ads, and you can switch at any time in the browser's settings. If you enable ads,
you ONLY see Brave ads, and you can even select how many!

## Brave IS faster than any other

- up to [66% less RAM memory usage](https://brave.com/memory-savings-in-brave/)
- 3x faster page-load times than Chrome
- Up to 1 hour more of battery life

Brave automatically removes slow ad-code from websites before even rendering, which means it cuts out ads faster than your next best ad-blocker extensions can.

See, extensions block ads after they have already loaded code into your browser. This is slower.

## Brave supports your Chrome extensions

Interestingly, Brave is actually built using Chromium. If you're not aware already, Chromium is the same open-source tech that Chrome, Edge and Opera are
built on top of.

However, Brave extends the chromium code, while still benefiting from weekly updates.

This means:

- Whenever Chromium gets an update, so does Brave
- You can be sure your browser's tech is as up-to-date as Chrome / Firefox / Opera
- You can literally use the Chrome App Store and use any of your favourite extentions, WITHOUT the tracking implications!

## Developer tools

Yep. It also has all the same Chrome dev tools, which is IDEAL for web developers. Nice.

## Get the Brave Browser
