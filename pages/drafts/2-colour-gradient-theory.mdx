When creating a gradient between two colours, often a gray dead zone appears in the middle.

See for yourself.

<div className="max-w-xs w-full mx-auto my-12 rounded-lg shadow-lg py-20 px-4 text-center" style={{ background: "linear-gradient(to right, aqua, red)" }}>
    <span className="!text-white text-xl">...Ewww</span>
</div>

I know. I know. Kill it with fire. ðŸ”¥



<div className={"max-w-xs mx-auto"}>
    <ColourWheel/>
</div>

- The tool was amazing, but I wanted to understand it further: lets build our own!

    - Tech:
        - HTML `<canvas/>`
        - JS
        - CSS
    - Theory:
        Generate a line that shows the colours in a correctly formed line, then bend it into a circle.
    - Colour Theory:
        We don't want to use RGB as it is "additive", instead we want to use HSV (Hue, Saturation Value) image.
        However, canvas works with RGB, so we'll need to convert from HSV to RGB.
    - Polar Coords!!! (what are polar coords) - convert


export default ({ children }) => <PostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</PostLayout>
