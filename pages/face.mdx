# Web GL face

Playing around with rendering glTF (GL Transmission Format) models from [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) on a website through WebGL ([Three JS](https://threejs.org/)).

Much work to be done on the model and animations, so for now the animation will just sit here on this hidden page until I have some free time to try and make my model less like its about to haunt your living nightmares... ðŸ˜‚
