# Cookies & Privacy

The requirement of spammy cookie popup notices could have been so easily avoided by popularising the ["Do Not Track (DNT)" flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) in browsers...

But alas, I'm in a country where every website must instead launch a huge cookie policy notice that visitors will
blindly accept because WHO HAS TIME to read it all!

Anyway, here's how I and potentially third parties use your cookies while enabled.

> This website, alongside 0.001% of the internet, respects your Do Not Track flag, so if you have Do Not Track enabled, cookies were disabled from the moment you got here.

## Summary of tracking on this website

Trackers:

* Google Analytics

Tracks user behaviour across the website. This is anonymized, so you're safe Jane, I don't know who you are.

*Imagine if your name was actually Jane... I would have had you for a moment there* ðŸ˜‰

Google achieves this by using cookies on your browser that follow you from website to website. I only get to see data that's generated
when you're on my website (matt-spence.com), so I have no idea you were browsing Facebook for 7 hours earlier.

## Disabling cookies

You can completely disable cookies by changing the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how you do this).
HOWEVER disabling cookies will affect and disable the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit.

You can also change the "Privacy Tracking Mode" on your browser. Unfortunately, this wasn't standardized before cookie policy laws came in,
so not every tracker or website respects this setting.

> The good news is, this website does respect your Privacy Tracking Mode, also known as the "Do Not Track" flag.

Lastly, you can opt out of cookie tracking with the cookie notices around this website. This is backwards however... to know if you requested
to disable cookie tracking, we actually HAVE to SET a cookie that says as such! Seriously, there's no other reasonable way to achieve this.
